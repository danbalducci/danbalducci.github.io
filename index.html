        <p><b>About me: </b> </p>
        Digital media to me represents the freedom of expression in so many different possible ways. 
        From the time I picked up my first camera, to editing my first video, I always loved the process of assembling and representing the subjects.
        My roots are embedded in skateboarding, and it gave me the drive to creativly advance within my processes to think and create.
        Early digital media interests derived from seeing so many digitally advanced technology as I was growing up in Japan. When I moved to the United States, I felt like I was in a new world surrounded by new designs, layouts, and life. I soon discovered my love for Art and digitally created media, I then soon found myself endowing in Digital media arts. It was the moment I decided to ask my mother for her camera so I can document my friends skateboarding, that would change everything i've come to known.</div></div>
